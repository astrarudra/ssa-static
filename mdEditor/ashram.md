**Discover Divine Insights at Sadhan Sangha Ashram**  
  
Welcome to Sadhan Sangha Ashram, a sanctuary where spiritual wisdom and tranquility converge. Nestled between the sacred towns of Rishikesh and Haridwar, our Ashram offers a serene environment for seekers to immerse themselves in the teachings of Yogi 108 Swami Sachchidananda Saraswati.  
  
**Our Journey**  
  
In 1970, the revered Swami Sachchidananda Saraswati embarked on a pilgrimage through North India. Enchanted by the celestial beauty of the region between Haridwar and Rishikesh, he felt a profound connection to the divine essence, envisioning it as the abode of Lord Shiva. Inspired by this divine encounter, he resolved to establish Sadhan Sangha Ashram near the Virbhadra railway station, with the support of his devoted disciples, Choudhury Saheb and Kapoor Saheb.  
  
**Humble Beginnings**  
  
The Ashram's journey began in 1979 with a humble cottage and a solitary well. Over the years, with unwavering dedication and divine grace, the Ashram has blossomed into a sanctuary of spiritual nourishment and inner peace. In 1984, a significant milestone was achieved with the consecration of the Mandir within the Ashram. The unveiling of Guruji's statue on November 2nd symbolized the eternal presence of wisdom and enlightenment within these hallowed grounds.
